\title{MAIC bootstrap sample}
\usage{
maic.boot(
  ipd,
  indices = 1:nrow(ipd),
  formula,
  family,
  ald,
  trt_var,
  hat_w = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ipd}{Individual-level patient data. Dataframe with one row per patient with outcome, treatment and covariate columns.}

\item{indices}{Vector of indices, same length as original,
which define the bootstrap sample}

\item{formula}{Linear regression \code{formula} object. Prognostic factors (PF) are main effects and effect modifiers (EM) are
interactions with the treatment variable, e.g., y ~ X1 + trt + trt:X2. For covariates as both PF and EM use \code{*} syntax.}

\item{family}{A 'family' object specifying the distribution and link function (e.g., 'binomial').
See stats::family() for more details.}

\item{ald}{Aggregate-level data. Long format summary statistics for each covariate and treatment outcomes.
We assume a common distribution for each treatment arm.}

\item{hat_w}{MAIC weights; default \code{NULL} which calls \code{\link[=maic_weights]{maic_weights()}}}
}
\value{
Vector of fitted probabilities for treatments \emph{A} and \emph{C}
}
\description{
Matching-adjusted indirect comparison bootstrap sampling.
