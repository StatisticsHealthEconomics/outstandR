\title{Calculate the difference between treatments using all evidence}
\usage{
outstandR(
  ipd_trial,
  ald_trial,
  strategy,
  ref_trt = NA,
  CI = 0.95,
  scale = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ipd_trial}{Individual-level patient data. For example, suppose between studies \emph{A} and \emph{C}.
In a long format and must contain a treatment column and outcome column consistent with the formula object.
The labels in the treatment are used internally so there must be a common treatment with the aggregate-level data trial.}

\item{ald_trial}{Aggregate-level data. For example, suppose between studies \emph{B} and \emph{C}. The column names are
\itemize{
\item \code{variable}: Covariate name. In the case of treatment arm sample size this is \code{NA}
\item \code{statistic}: Summary statistic name from "mean", standard deviation "sd", probability "prop", or "sum"
\item \code{value}: Numerical value of summary statistic
\item \code{trt}: Treatment label. Because we assume a common covariate distribution between treatment arms this is \code{NA}
}}

\item{strategy}{Computation strategy function. These can be
\code{strategy_maic()}, \code{strategy_stc()}, \code{strategy_gcomp_ml()} and \code{strategy_gcomp_stan()}.}

\item{ref_trt}{Reference / common / anchoring treatment name.}

\item{CI}{Confidence interval; between 0,1}

\item{scale}{Relative treatment effect scale. If \code{NULL}, the scale is automatically determined from the model.
Choose from "log-odds", "log_relative_risk", "risk_difference", "delta_z", "mean_difference", "rate_difference" depending on the data type.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Currently, can pass named arguments to \code{rstanarm::stan_glm()} via \code{strategy_gcomp_stan()}.}
}
\value{
List of length 3 of statistics as a \code{outstandR} class object.
Containing statistics between each pair of treatments.
These are the mean, variances and confidence intervals,
for contrasts and absolute values.
